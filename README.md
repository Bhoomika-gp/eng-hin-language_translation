# English to Hindi Translation Project

This project focuses on implementing an English-to-Hindi translation system using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project utilizes the `cfilt/iitb-english-hindi` dataset and the pre-trained `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-hi` model to achieve the translation task. The translation process is broken down into several stages, each contributing to the overall success of the project.

## Conclusion

This English to Hindi Translation project demonstrates the process of setting up a translation system using the Hugging Face Transformers library. Each stage plays a crucial role in the successful execution of the project, from data validation to model training and evaluation. The project showcases how to leverage powerful pre-trained models to achieve accurate translation results.
